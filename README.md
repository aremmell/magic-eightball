# magic-eightball

If you're nostalgic like me, believe in fate, or are just a nerd (*read: not dork; big difference*), I think you'll enjoy the *magic eightball*.

I find it particularly useful & funny to ask if you should or shouldn't do some thing that you can't make your mind up about.

When you're in that situation along with a friend or family member, it's even more enjoyable. One of you can ask the magic eightball, and be pleased or disappointedâ€“depending on the answer.

Since I cannot actually manufacture a plastic ball filled with liquid, I have at least ensured that the set of answers that are possible for any given question are the original set from the toy.
